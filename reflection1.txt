1. It's often very difficult to spot subtle differences between two rows of text. The computer is much better suited to the task!
2. The diff utility in Linux is good in that it still shows only the lines that are different together with three lines before and 3 lines after the lines that are different, thus showing the context of each of the differences.
3. The diff function allows one to quickly identify the differences and exclude items that are the same.
4. The diff application only works with text files.
5. The location of each of the changes is identified in the diff output which is preceeded by a '@@' and the line number in the file.
6. The order that the files are listed when invoking the diff function is important. If the old file is given first, then the '-' indicates the lines that were removed from the old file and '+' indicates the text that was added in the new file.
7. The fact that the entire lines are shown in the old and the new file helps show the differences in context within the line.
