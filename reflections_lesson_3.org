** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When working collaboratively on code.
2. To ensure the code is backed up off site.
** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
1. To ensure that changes covered a single feature change to the code.
2. The coder is the only person who can decide what changes in one, or more files, need to be done to deliver the feature change.
